## Overview
This repository contains a sample project demonstrating the usage of the StateMachinePackage with a Hierarchical State Machine (HSM).

### What is a Hierarchical State Machine (HSM)?
A Hierarchical State Machine (HSM) is a more flexible version of a finite state machine (FSM), allowing nested states where child states can extend the behavior of parent states. This simplifies managing complex systems with multiple layers of state logic.

## Installation
1. Open the Unity Package Manager.
2. Import the StateMachineSample as an optional example.

## Usage
- Open the sample scene.
- Test the example states and transitions.
